## Introduction

The weather forecast app is my second Vue 2 application. The user can select the country code and type the city name to get the current forecast. Country codes and flags are fetched from Rest countries API url( https://restcountries.eu ). The app fetches 10 days of weather forecast url( https://api.weatherbit.io/v2.0 ) and displays the average temperature for the next 10 days. The dates are converted with moment.js and the build-in Date method. The weekly forecast is made out of 7 rotating week-day cards for each of the next 7 days. The front of the week-day card displays the day name, average temperature, and weather icon, the back shows details (wind-speed, min/max temp, humidity, and cloud coverage. The background gradient is bound to the average temperature and changes accordingly.
